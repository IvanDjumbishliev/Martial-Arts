                <b>Muay Thai</b>, which translates to “Thai Boxing”, is the national sport of Thailand. It is a martial art with roots originating from military use dating back to around the 13th century during the time of the Sukhothai Kingdom.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                <b>Muay Thai</b> is known as the “Art of 8 limbs” because it makes use of 8 points of contact namely, punches, elbows, knees and kicks. This differs it from other stand-up combat sports such as boxing (2 points - fists) and karate (4 points - fists and feet).

            <h2>WHAT IS MUAY THAI OR THAI BOXING?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p id="par">Today, Muay Thai is practised and competed not only in Thailand, but also all around the world.</p>
            <div class="info">
                
                <p class="theory">
                    “Muay” translates to mean “boxing” in Thai, so Muay Thai is literally Thai boxing. Taking elements from Muay Boran, the traditional Thai martial arts, Muay Thai as a modern combat sport was first formalized in the early 20th century. The sport was influenced by British boxing where codified rules and the boxing ring were put in place. During this period, fighters also ditched wrapping hands with ropes (“Kard Chuek”) and began wearing boxing gloves in competitions.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p class="theory">
                    Muay Thai is a stand-up striking sport, with two competitors in the ring throwing punches, elbows, knees and kicks at each other. Clinching, sweeps and throws are also allowed. Besides the 8-point contact, a key difference between Muay Thai and many other stand-up combat sports is its emphasis on traditional elements such as the pre-fight dance ritual known as Wai Kru Ram Muay, the head dress (Mongkon) and the Sarama music that accompanies each fight.

            <h2>MUAY THAI HISTORY</h2>  
            <hr>
            <p class="theory">Karate is divided into many styles, each with their different training methods, focuses, and cultures; though they mainly originate from the historical Okinawan parent styles of Naha-te, Tomari-te and Shuri-te.</p>
            
            <div class="info">
                <br> 
                <p class="theory">
                    However some of the schools' founders have been sceptical with the separation of karate into many styles. Gichin Funakoshi simply stated that there are as many styles as instructors in the world while Kenwa Mabuni explained that the notion of different variations of karate came from outsiders. During karate popularization in mainland Japan, it was spread the idea that karate was divided into two branches: Shōrin-ryū and Shōrei-ryū; but Chōjun Miyagi believed that was just a wrong perception. Mas Oyama was actively opposed to the idea of the break-down into several karate schools. He believed that making karate a combat sport, as well keeping it as a martial art, could be a possible approach to unify all schools.
                </p>
                 <hr>
                <p class="theory">
                    Due to wars with neighboring kingdoms and tribes over the centuries, Muay Thai became a way of life for the people of Siam (as Thailand used to be called). One of the most famous stories of Muay Thai came via the great Nai Khanom Tom, during the Ayutthaya period. The tale narrates how Nai Khanom Tom defeated 9 Burmese fighters, one after another, during his imprisonment after the Siam kingdom was under siege. The historical event (half steeped in myth) is now celebrated as Muay Thai day which takes place every year on March 17th.

            <h2>MUAY THAI TECHNIQUES</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="theory">
                Muay Thai techniques can be generally classed into attack, defense, and counter technique. To become adept in Muay Thai requires constant practise, drilling the techniques over and over until they form part of muscle memory.
            </p>
            <div class="info">
                <br>
                <p class="theory">
                    Muay Thai training begins with learning the basic stance and movement. With the chin tucked in, the body is kept upright and hands in guard position to protect the head, and feet are kept roughly shoulder-width apart. Right-handers keep their left foot a little to the front while keeping their right feet roughly 45 degrees to the outside. Left-handers (Southpaws) do it in reverse with their right foot in front. This posture allows the fighter to be in balance and ready to strike or defend when appropriate.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p class="theory">
                    Attacking techniques consist of punches, elbow strikes, knee strikes, kicks, push kicks and clinches. Defense techniques consist of blocks, lean backs, deflections, leg catches and dodges. These techniques mix and match to combine into combinations(combo) that can be used for attack or counter. An example of a combo that is often taught and used is the jab-cross-low kick. Each attacking technique includes a series of variations.

            <h2>MODERN  MUAY THAI</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="theory">
                Muay Thai has grown over years since around World War I period to become a combat sport loved and practised all around the world. Modern Muay Thai encompasses elements of traditional boxing including the use of padded boxing gloves, 3 to 5 rounds with time limit, defined rules and take place within a ring (squared platform).
            </p>
            <div class="info">
                <br>
                <p class="theory">
                    Muay Thai takes much of its strikes and techniques from ancient Muay Thai, also commonly known as Muay Boran. Muay Boran was created primarily for hand-to-hand combat during warfare. As the sport evolves, dangerous techniques from Muay Boran that may be deadly have become forbidden in Muay Thai such as strikes to the joints or back of the head.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p class="theory">
                    Other than variations of punches as seen in western boxing (e.g. jabs, crosses, hooks, uppercuts), kicks, elbows and knee strikes are used in Muay Thai. Clinching, sweeps and throws are also used strategically in modern Muay Thai to make it an all-rounded combat art. Due to the 8-point contact, the sport has proven to be one of the most effective stand-up striking art and practised by many mixed martial artists.
