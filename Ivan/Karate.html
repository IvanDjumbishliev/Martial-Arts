                <b>Karate</b>, also karate-do, is a martial art developed in the Ryukyu Kingdom. It developed from the indigenous Ryukyuan martial arts under the influence of Chinese martial arts. While modern karate is primarily a striking art that uses punches and kicks, traditional karate also employs throwing and joint locking techniques. A karate practitioner is called a karate-ka.

                <b>Kyokushin</b> is a style of karate originating in Japan. It is a full-contact style of stand-up fighting and is rooted in a philosophy of self-improvement, discipline, and hard training.

Kyokushin Kaikan is the martial arts organization founded in 1964 by Korean-Japanese Masutatsu Oyama, officially the International Karate Organization. Previously, this institution was known as the Oyama Dojo. Since 1964, the style has continued to spread to more than 120 countries, becoming one of the largest martial arts organizations in the world, and in Japan itself.

            <p id="par">There are several theories regarding the origins of karate, but the main ones are as follows</p>

                    <b>Theory of development from mēkata</b>
                    <br>
                    In Okinawa, there was an ancient martial dance called mēkata. The dancers danced to the accompaniment of songs and sanshin music, similar to karate kata. In the Okinawan countryside, mēkata remained until the early 20th century. There is a theory that from this mēkata with martial elements, was born and developed into karate. This theory is advocated by Ankō Asato and his student Gichin Funakoshi.

                <p class="theory">
                    <b>Theory of introduction by thirty-six families from Min</b>
                    <br>
                    It is said that in 1392, a group of professional people known as the "Thirty-six families from Min" migrated to Kume Village (now Kume, Naha City) in Naha from Fujian Province in the Ming Dynasty at that time. They brought with them advanced learning and skills to Ryukyu, and there is a theory that Chinese kenpō, the origin of karate, was also brought to Ryukyu at this time.
                    There is also the "Keichō import theory," which states that karate was brought to Ryukyu after the invasion of Ryukyu by the Satsuma Domain, as well as the theory that it was introduced by Kōshōkun based on the description in Ōshima Writing.

            <h2>Techniques</h2>  
            <hr>
            <p class="theory">Karate is divided into many styles, each with their different training methods, focuses, and cultures; though they mainly originate from the historical Okinawan parent styles of Naha-te, Tomari-te and Shuri-te.</p>
            
            <div class="info">

                <p class="theory">
                    However some of the schools' founders have been sceptical with the separation of karate into many styles. Gichin Funakoshi simply stated that there are as many styles as instructors in the world while Kenwa Mabuni explained that the notion of different variations of karate came from outsiders. During karate popularization in mainland Japan, it was spread the idea that karate was divided into two branches: Shōrin-ryū and Shōrei-ryū; but Chōjun Miyagi believed that was just a wrong perception. Mas Oyama was actively opposed to the idea of the break-down into several karate schools. He believed that making karate a combat sport, as well keeping it as a martial art, could be a possible approach to unify all schools.

                    In the modern era the major four styles of karate are considered to be Gōjū-ryū, Shotokan, Shitō-ryū, and Wadō-ryū. These four styles are those recognised by the World Karate Federation for international kata competition. Some widespread styles oftenly accepted for kata competition include Kyokushin, Shōrin-ryū or Uechi-Ryū among others.

                "True karate is this: that in daily life one’s mind and body be trained and developed in a spirit of humility, and that in critical times, one be devoted utterly to the cause of justice.”  — Gichin Funakoshi

                Karate practice benefits the student in all areas of their life. It is not an end, but a means to an end. Karate encourages proficiency and the keen coordination of mind and body. It is an activity in which advancing age is not a hindrance.

                    Karate practice strengthens the mind, develops composure, a clearer thought process, deeper insight into one’s mental capabilities, and more self-confidence.
                    It strengthens the entire body, improves coordination, quickens reflexes, builds stamina and overall health.
