<h1>Welcome to kick boxing!</h1>
<h2>What is Kick Boxing?</h2>
<p class="Info">
    Kickboxing is a full-contact hybrid martial art and boxing type based on punching and kicking.
    Kickboxing originated in the 1950s to 1970s.[2] The fight takes place in a boxing ring, normally with boxing gloves, 
    mouth guards, shorts, and bare feet to favor the use of kicks. Kickboxing is practiced for self-defense, general fitness, or for competition.
    some styles of kickboxing include:<u>ull contact karate, Muay Thai, Japanese kickboxing, Lethwei, Sanda, and Savate.</u>
    Kickboxing originated in the 1970s and was brought to prominence in September 1974, when the Professional Karate Association (PKA)
    held the first World Championships. Historically, kickboxing can be considered a hybrid martial art formed from the combination of elements of
    various traditional styles. This approach became increasingly popular since the 1970s, and since the 1990s, kickboxing has contributed 
    to the emergence of mixed martial arts via further hybridization with ground fighting techniques from Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and folk wrestling.

<h2>Modern day Kickboxing</h2>
<p class="Modern">
    <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tqsWf9dvm9k/maxresdefault.jpg">
    Kickboxing has a number of different rulesets. For example, Oriental/K-1 rules allow punches, 
    high and low kicks and even knee strikes, while American kickboxing is limited to punches and kicks only above the belt (high kicks).
    In the first two decades of the 21st century, several larger kickboxing promotions such as Glory,
    One Championship and Bellator Kickboxing have adopted the k1/oriental rule set, which allows knee strikes, kicking and punching.<br>
    Here are some rules:
    <ul class="Rules">
        <li>
            Fighters are allowed to strike their opponent with punches,
            kicks, including kicks below the waist(<b>Above the waist for American style</b>), except for the groin, sweeps and knees (only to the body).
        </li>
        <li>
            Elbows and knees are forbidden.(<b>Allowed for Korean style</b>)
        </li>
        <li>
            Very limited or no clinch fighting is allowed (in some competitions clinching is completely illegal,
            in others only one single strike is allowed before the clinch has to be released,in other promotions just a few seconds of clinch are allowed[50]).
            (<b>For Korean it is not limited but in American it is forbidden to clinch</b>).
        </li>
        <li>
            Throws and headbutts are not allowed.(<b>Throwing is allowed in Korean and American style</b>).
        </li>
        <li>
            Bouts are usually 3 to 10 rounds(to 5 in Japanese style) (lasting 2 minutes each(3 minutes to Japanese style)) with a 1-minute rest in between rounds.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Referee is responsible for fighter safety and keeping to the rules;
             judges count legal techniques and note the points on the scoring card or with the help of the electronic system.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fun fact:<b>Spinning techniques are allowed in Korean style.</b>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Point fighting.</h2>
<p class="Points"><img src="https://kick-box.hu/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/p01.jpg">
    Semi Contact or Points Fighting, is the variant of American kickboxing most similar to karate, 
since it consists in fighting for the purpose of scoring points with an emphasis on delivery, speed, and technique.

boxing gloves, groin-guard, shin-pads, kick-boots, and headgear.
