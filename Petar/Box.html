        <h2>What is boxing?</h2>
        <p>
            Boxing is a combat sport and a martial art[ in which two people, usually wearing protective gloves
            and other protective equipment such as hand wraps and mouthguards,
            throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring.
            Although the term boxing is commonly attributed to western boxing, in which only fists are involved, it has
            developed in different ways in different geographical areas and cultures of the World. In global terms,
            "boxing" today is also a set of combat sports focused on striking, in which two opponents face each other
            in a fight using at least their fists, and possibly involving other actions such as kicks, elbow strikes,
            knee strikes, and headbutts, depending on the rules. Some of these variants are the bare-knuckle boxing,
            kickboxing, Muay Thai, Lethwei, savate, and sanda.
            Boxing techniques have been incorporated into many martial arts, military systems, and other combat sports.
            A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of
            continuing,
            disqualifies an opponent, or the opponent resigns. When the fight reaches the end of its final round with
            both opponents still standing,
            the judges' scorecards determine the victor. In case both fighters gain equal scores from the judges, a
            professional bout is considered a draw.
            In Olympic boxing, because a winner must be declared,
            judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria.
            here are many factors that inform the judge's decision but the most important of these are: clean punching,
            effective aggressiveness, ring generalship and defense.
            Judges use these metrics as a means of discerning which fighter has a clear advantage over the other,
            regardless of how minute the advantage.
            <u>Professional bouts are limited to a maximum of twelve rounds, where each round last 3 minutes for men, 2
                minutes for women.</u>

            the Queensberry Rules.

        <p>The modern sport arose from illegal venues and outlawed prizefighting and has become a multibillion-dollar
            commercial enterprise.
            the role of the officials, and produced a system of scoring that enabled the referee to decide the result of
            a fight.
            Through the late nineteenth century, the martial art of boxing or prizefighting was primarily a sport of
            dubious legitimacy.
            Outlawed in England and much of the United States, prizefights were often held at gambling venues and broken
            up by police.
            Brawling and wrestling tactics continued, and riots at prizefights were common occurrences.
            Still, throughout this period, there arose some notable bare knuckle champions who developed fairly
            sophisticated fighting tactics.
            In the early twentieth century, most professional bouts took place in the United States and Britain,
            and champions were recognised by popular consensus as expressed in the newspapers of the day.
